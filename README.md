##Titanic SQL project along with a dashboard created using Tableau.

Dataset: https://github.com/shivani-mengade/Titanic/blob/main/titanic.csv

Project Objective
Segmentation & Comparative Analysis
Identify whether survival rates differ significantly across demographic and situational segments (e.g. gender, age group, class, port of embarkation, family status). 
Hypothesis Testing / Statistical Significance
Test hypotheses like “Women had a higher survival rate than men,” or “First class passengers had greater survival odds,” using SQL-derived aggregates and statistical measures.


##Exploratory SQL Analysis (Questions & Findings)

•	Number of man and women who survived?

•	Number of man and women who didn’t survived?

•	What was the percent of dead and alive?

•	What was the Survival by Passenger Class?

•	What was the survival percent by Gender?

•	What was the Survival by Age?

•	Fare analysis.

•	What people spent on tickets?

•	What was the survival Rate for Families vs. Solo Travelers?

•	What was the relationship Between Fare & Survival?

•	Correlation Between Family Size and Survival

##Conclusion

Gender is the strongest predictor of survival.

Passenger class / socioeconomic status matters.

Age has a moderate effect.

Missing and noisy data limit certainty.
